# Studying Encourager
<h2>Console App</h2>
<h3>
I had made a console app that encourages me to study </h3>
<h3>The app is very dynamic and shows to you the time that you had studied </h3>
<h3>I had used Date Class , SimpleDateFormat Class, and notification API</h3>
<h3>You can use it by writing the time in isNow function like isNow(10); it will shows a notification every 10 minutes </h3>
